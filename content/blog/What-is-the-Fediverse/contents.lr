blurb:

The short version is as follows:

Mastodon is a Twitter-like social network, and the Fediverse is a
network of social networks.

But let's also delve into the slightly longer version below.
---
body:

What is Mastodon?
=================

One could say that [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is an Open
Source alternative to [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com). If you're
familiar with how Twitter works, then Mastodon isn't that hard to get
used to.

Why should I use Mastodon over Twitter?
---------------------------------------

**If you don't like how Mastodon is being run, you can go to another
Mastodon instance.** That's right - there are multiple Mastodon
instances, all being run slightly differently by different people. If
you're being harassed on Twitter and Twitter won't help you, you're
out of luck - there's no "other Twitter" to go to. But Mastodon is
different. There are many Mastodon instances, all run by different
people. But the Mastodon instances are connected in a giant network
called the Fediverse (more on that below), which means that if you
have an account on one Mastodon instance, you can still follow and
interact with people who have accounts on another instance. Each
Mastodon instance has its own URL - the most popular and well-known
one is [Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social), but there are many
others. Oh, and by the way, if you're confused by the ".social" part of
the URL, that's just another top level domain now, just like .com and
.org.

**You should use Mastodon because it's truly free.** Mastodon isn't
run by a corporation to make money. It is run by hobbyists (typically)
because they *enjoy* it. They're not trying to make money off your
data, they don't track you, and there are no ads.

So how do I know which Mastodon instance I should join?
-------------------------------------------------------

Each instance typically has a theme, or a topic. If you're into
technology in general, there's for example one called
[Mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology). There are Mastodon
instances for various social groups, and languages. If you go to
[joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org) you can find a list.

Personally, I'm partial to the Instance I'm running targeted at Python
developers of all stripes -
[PythonDevs.social](https://pythondevs.social) (although it's not
strictly a Mastodon instance, it runs another software called Pleroma
which is compatible with Mastodon).

Can I use Mastodon from my smartphone?
--------------------------------------

Yes, you can use Mastodon (and Pleroma, as in the case of
[PythonDevs.social](https://pythondevs.social), since it's compatible
with Mastodon) various apps. When it comes to Android, I
would recommend
[Tusky](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky&hl=en_US),
but you can search the App Store and Play Store for "Mastodon", and
you'll find a variety of available apps. Also, you can use the web
interface on your smartphone as well as your desktop by simply
clicking on the link to an instance, such as
[PythonDevs.social](https://pythondevs.social). 

What is the Fediverse?
======================

Okay. By now, I hope we all at least sort of understand what Mastodon
is. So what's this about Fediverse? What's that?

I'm glad you asked. Let's say you have a Twitter account, and you want
to follow your friend. But she doesn't have a Twitter account, she
only has a Facebook account - and for one reason or another, you don't
want a Facebook account, and she doesn't want a Twitter account.

That means you simply can't follow eachother. Such is life. The end.

The Fediverse is different. As I said initially, the Fediverse is a
network of social networks. For example, Mastodon instances are
connected to the Fediverse. [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org), an
open source alternative to YouTube, is also connected to the
Fediverse, as is [Friendica](https://friendi.ca) which is more like
Facebook than Twitter. This means that **any user on any of these
instances can follow and interact with any other user on any other
instance**, as if a Twitter user could follow a Facebook user.

How do you handle abuse in the Fediverse?
-----------------------------------------

First of all, you should find an instance where you agree with the
Terms of Service (they're typically short, and easy to understand).
For example, you can find the Terms of Service on
[PythonDevs.social](https://pythondevs.social) by clicking
[About](https://pythondevs.social/about) on its start page.

You can report users who misbehave, just like on any other social
network. Most instances are small, and have active administrators who
care about dealing with such things. But what if there's an instance
which doesn't care if their users abuse the rest of us? Then what do
we do?

Introducing Gab. Gab is Fediverse instance which values free speech
over everything else. They let their users pretty much say and do
anything they want, including harassing other people. This means that
nazis, homophobes, bullies, and other lowlives flock to Gab (I think
of Gab as a bridge, under which the trolls live). At the risk of
sounding like Trump, I'll add that I assume that there are some good
people on Gab as well who simply value free speech over the ability to
be an unfettered asshole, but I'd wager they're in the minority.

This unwillingness of dealing with trolls on the part of the Gab
administration posed a problem for the Fediverse, which most of us
instance administrators simply dealt with by blocking all content from
Gab on our instances. This means that while Gab is technically part of
the Fediverse, almost all Fediverse instances refuse to communicate
with them. We simply leave them alone to stew in their echo chamber of
hate, homophobia, and general assholery. At least we don't have to see
any of it - unless we choose to join an instance which doesn't block
Gab, or even Gab itself.

But none of my friends use the Fediverse!
=========================================

The Fediverse is a ghost town! I don't know anyone there! All my
friends are on Twitter and Facebook!

Sure. But instead of finding your friends in the Fediverse, you can
make friends with the people that are there! Again, find an instance
that caters to your interest, and start talking to people on that
instance. And keep at it - keep coming back, and you'll find that you
have meaningful interactions with like-minded people every time you
do.

Come join pythondevs.social and say hi
======================================

If this post has piqued your interest, and if you're into Python
development (which I assume you are since you're on
[pythonvarmland.se](https://www.pythonvarmland.se)), then I encourage
you to come join us at [PythonDevs.social](https://pythondevs.social).
The instance is focused on Python development, but it's not just for
Python developers from VÃ¤rmland - it's open to everybody. You'll find
me at [PythonDevs.social/Enfors](https://pythondevs.social/Enfors). In
a future blog post, I'll go into a little more detail about this
particular instance, and what it can offer Python developers.
