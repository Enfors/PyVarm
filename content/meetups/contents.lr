title: Meetups
---
body:

The plan is to host around four meetups each year, where Python users
can meet up to learn from one another and make new friends. I'm
currently in the process to finding a venue in Karlstad which we can
use for these meetups - but I'm open to having events in other parts
of Värmland too - after all, this is Python Värmland, not Python
Karlstad.
