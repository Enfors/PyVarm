If you're totally new to Python
-------------------------------

- [Python for Absolute Beginners](beginners/) is a good
  starting point if you're new to Python. It is written in a way that
  makes it useful both to people who are completely new to
  programming, as well as people who are experienced with other
  programming languages.
